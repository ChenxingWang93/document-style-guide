the notes below apply to technical papers in computer science and electrical engineering on papers in systems and networks.

Read Strunk and White, **Elements of Style**. Again.


Give the paper to somebody else to read. If you can, find two people: One people familar with the technical matter, another only generally familar with the area.


papers can be divided roughly into 2 categories, namely original _research papers_ and _survey papers_.there are papers that combine the two elements, but most publication venues either only accept one or the other type or require the author to identify whether the paper should be evaluated as a research contribution or a survey paper.(Most research paper contain a "related work" section that can be considered a survey, but it is usually brief compared to the rest of the paper and only addresses a much narrower slice of the field.)


## Research Papers 
a good research paper has a clear statement of the paper is addressing, the proposed solution(s), and results achieved. It describes clearly what has been done before on the problem, and what is new.


The goal of a paper is to describe novel technical results. There are four types of technical results:

1. An algorithm;
<details>
<summary>2. A system construct: such as hardware design, software system, protocol, etc.; </summary>
        One goal of the paper is to ensure that the next person who designs a system like yours does not make the same mistakes and takes advantage of some of your best solutions. So make sure that the hard problems (and their solutions) are discussed and the non-obvious mistakes(and how to avoid them) are discussed (Craig Partridge)

  3.A performance evaluation: obtained through analyses, simulation or measurements;


  4.A theory: consisting of a collection of theorems.


A paper should focus on 

- describing the results in sufficient details to establish their validity;
- identifying the novel aspects of the results, i.e., what new knowledge is reported and what makes it non-obvious;
- identifying the significance of the results: what improvements and impact do they suggest.

- Typical outline of a paper is:
   - Abstract, typically not more than 100-150 words;
   - [Introduction](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/etc/intro-style.html)(brief!): introduce problem, outline solution; the statement of the problem should include a clear statement why the problem is important (or interesting).
   - Related Work (or before summary). Hint: In the case of a conference, make sure to cite the work of the PC co-chairs and as many other PC members as are remotely plausible, as well as from anything relevant from the previous two proceedings. In the case of a journal or magazine, cite anything relevant from last 2-3 years or so volumes.
   - Outline of the rest of the paper: "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce ..Section 3 describes ... Finally, we describe future work in Section 5." [Note that Section is capitalized. Also, vary your expression between "section" being the subject of the sentence, as in "Section 2 discusses ..." and "In Section, we discuss ...".]
   - Body of paper
     - problem
     - approach, architecture
     - results
